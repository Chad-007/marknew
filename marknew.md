# Proposal for Mitstober Fest 2024 at MITS

## Introduction

This proposal outlines the plan for hosting **Mitstober Fest 2024** at **Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science (MITS)**. Mitstober Fest is part of the global Hacktoberfest initiative, aimed at encouraging open-source contributions through collaboration, learning, and hands-on project development. By organizing this event at MITS, we aim to foster an open-source culture, provide students with practical experience, and enable them to contribute to real-world projects while enhancing their technical skills.

## Objective

The primary objective of Mitstober Fest 2024 is to engage students in contributing to open-source repositories managed by various teams within MITS. The event seeks to empower students to make meaningful contributions to software projects, ranging from bug fixes to feature development, while helping them understand the dynamics of collaboration in the open-source community.

## Event Scope

Mitstober Fest 2024 will be a month-long event where students across different departments can participate. They will contribute to a range of GitHub repositories owned by MITS-based teams, with projects spanning areas such as web development, mobile apps, data science, and more. Mentors will be available throughout the event to guide participants in making impactful contributions.

### Key Areas of Contribution:

- Code enhancements and new feature implementation
- Bug fixing and resolution
- Improvements in project documentation
- User experience and design updates

## Event Structure

### 1. **Open Repositories**

Participants will have access to a variety of open-source repositories. Each repository will come with detailed contribution guidelines, making it easier for participants to understand how and where they can contribute.

### 2. **Contribution Process**

- **Fork and Pull Requests (PRs)**: Participants will fork the repositories, make their contributions, and submit pull requests.
- **Types of Contributions**: Contributions can range from code development and bug fixes to documentation enhancements and testing.
- **Review by Maintainers**: Each repository will have maintainers responsible for reviewing pull requests, ensuring their quality and relevance, and providing feedback.

### 3. **Evaluation and Point System**

Contributions will be evaluated based on:

- **Code Quality**: Well-structured, maintainable, and optimized code will be rewarded with higher points.
- **Impact**: Submissions that address key issues or bring substantial improvements will be recognized with additional points.
- **Documentation**: Enhancing the clarity, structure, and accessibility of documentation will be acknowledged.

### 4. **Leaderboard and Recognition**

A leaderboard will track the progress of participants, ranking them based on the points they earn for their contributions. This system will encourage healthy competition while rewarding those who make significant, high-quality contributions. The leaderboard will be updated regularly to keep participants motivated.

### 5. **Mentorship and Support**

Mentors and repository maintainers will provide ongoing support to participants. They will offer guidance on technical challenges, review contributions, and ensure participants have a positive learning experience throughout the event.

## Incentives and Rewards

Participants will be eligible for the following incentives:

- **Certificates of Participation**: All contributors will receive certificates.
