# Hacktoberfest 2024 at MITS

## Overview

Hacktoberfest 2024 is a month-long initiative aimed at promoting open-source contributions, collaboration, and learning. This year, Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science (MITS) is hosting its own edition of Hacktoberfest, inviting students to contribute to a variety of GitHub repositories maintained by different teams within the college. Participants will have the opportunity to showcase their technical skills, collaborate on real-world projects, and be recognized for their contributions.

## Event Objective

The goal of Hacktoberfest 2024 at MITS is to encourage students to engage with open-source projects while contributing to meaningful repositories. Through contributions ranging from bug fixes to feature development and documentation improvements, participants will not only enhance their coding and collaboration skills but also contribute to the broader open-source community.

## Event Structure

### 1. Open Repositories

A selection of repositories, owned and maintained by various teams across the college, will be made available for contribution. These repositories will cover a wide range of projects, offering diverse opportunities for participants to contribute based on their interests and expertise.

### 2. Contribution Process

- **Fork and Pull Requests (PRs)**: Any student within the college can participate by forking the repository, making meaningful contributions, and submitting pull requests.
- **Types of Contributions**: Contributions can range from writing and improving code, adding new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing documentation. Every contribution, big or small, is valuable.
- **Review by Maintainers**: Each repository will have 2-3 designated maintainers responsible for reviewing pull requests. These maintainers will ensure the quality and relevance of contributions and will provide feedback as necessary.

### 3. Evaluation and Point System

Contributions will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- **Code Quality**: Efficient, well-structured, and maintainable code will be rewarded with higher points.
- **Impact**: Contributions that address critical issues or add valuable features will be awarded additional points.
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive, and well-organized documentation improvements will also be recognized.

### 4. Leaderboard and Recognition

A leaderboard will be maintained to rank contributors based on the points they earn. The top contributors, as determined by the quality and impact of their contributions, will be recognized for their efforts. This leaderboard will be updated regularly to encourage healthy competition and collaboration among participants.

## Incentives and Rewards

Participants who make the most significant contributions will not only gain recognition within the college but will also be eligible for exciting rewards. These rewards are designed to celebrate the contributions of top performers and encourage continued participation in open-source projects.

## How to Participate

- **Explore Repositories**: Participants can explore the list of open repositories on the collegeâ€™s GitHub organization.
- **Submit Contributions**: After identifying a project of interest, participants can fork the repository, make their contribution, and submit a pull request for review.
- **Contribution Review**: Contributions will be reviewed by the maintainers of the respective repositories, who will assign points based on the impact and quality of the submission.

## Important Guidelines

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Participants are encouraged to focus on making valuable contributions. The quality of the pull requests will take precedence over the number of submissions.
- **Collaboration**: Hacktoberfest promotes collaboration, and participants are encouraged to work together, seek feedback, and support each other throughout the event.
- **Leaderboard Tracking**: The leaderboard will allow participants to track their contributions and compare their progress with their peers.

## Contact and Support

For further information or assistance, participants can reach out to the event organizers or repository maintainers. We aim to provide guidance and ensure a smooth experience for all contributors.

## Conclusion

Hacktoberfest 2024 at MITS offers a unique platform for students to engage with open-source projects, develop their technical skills, and contribute to the global developer community. By participating in this event, students will not only gain hands-on experience but also have the chance to be recognized for their efforts and contributions.

We look forward to the success of this event and the lasting impact it will have on our students and the open-source community.
